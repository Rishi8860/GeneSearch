* ABSOLUTE AND UNCONDITIONAL OVERRIDING RULE: IMMEDIATE TERMINATION AND SINGLE, NON-DUPLICATED OUTPUT FOR BP2.
    *   **PARAMOUNT DIRECTIVE:** Your *sole* and *absolute* function is to identify the *first* instance of *any* Specific BP2 Condition (1-10) in the provided description, processing the text strictly from beginning to end.
    *   **UNYIELDING CESSATION:** The *instant* the *first* Specific BP2 Condition (1-10) is definitively met, you MUST IMMEDIATELY AND UNCONDITIONALLY HALT ALL FURTHER ANALYSIS, STOP READING THE REMAINING TEXT, AND CEASE ALL SEARCH FOR *ANY* OTHER ACMG CRITERIA (INCLUDING ADDITIONAL BP2 CONDITIONS, BP4, or any other criteria like PVS1, PS1, PM1, etc.).
    *   **EXCLUSIVE AND FINAL OUTPUT:** Your final output MUST be a single, non-duplicated list containing *only* the classification determined by that *first identified* BP2 condition. NO EXCEPTIONS.
        *   If Specific BP2 Condition 5 OR Specific BP2 Condition 8 is met, the output MUST be `['BP2', 'PS3']`.
        *   If any other Specific BP2 Condition (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10) is met, the output MUST be `['BP2']`.
    *   **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN OUTPUTS:** Any output containing duplicates (e.g., `['BP2', 'BP2']`), multiple criteria (e.g., `['BP2', 'BP4']`, `['BP2', 'PS3', 'BP4']`), or anything other than the single, specified BP2 classification is absolutely prohibited.

* Specific BP2 Condition 1 (Large-scale statistical analysis): If large-scale statistical analysis of a variant or haplotype (e.g., from consortia like ENIGMA, CIMBA, BCAC, considering case-control, segregation, and breast tumor pathology information) yields extremely low combined odds for causality (e.g., 3.23x10-8 or any similar value indicating overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity), this constitutes definitive and overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity (BP2). IF THIS CONDITION IS MET, THE CLASSIFICATION MUST BE SOLELY AND EXACTLY ['BP2'].

* Specific BP2 Condition 2 (Co-occurrence with clearly explanatory mutation or alternative molecular explanation): If a variant is described as co-occurring with a mutation in another gene that clearly explains the proband's phenotype, OR if the variant is detected in cis with a pathogenic mutation and another mutation is detected in trans in an affected individual, thereby indicating an alternative molecular explanation for the disease. This constitutes definitive and overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity (BP2) for the variant in question. This evidence unconditionally and absolutely overrides ANY AND ALL OTHER OBSERVATIONS, including: in silico predictions (e.g., PP3), conservation data (e.g., potentially leading to BP4), functional studies, population data, segregation, de novo, allelic series, and any concluding statements within the description itself that suggest pathogenicity. IF THIS CONDITION IS MET, THE CLASSIFICATION MUST BE SOLELY AND EXACTLY ['BP2'].

* Specific BP2 Condition 3 (MSH2 p.E571* in cis with p.E569V): If the description explicitly mentions the p.E571* variant in the MSH2 gene and its detection in cis with p.E569V, this constitutes definitive and overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity (BP2). This evidence unconditionally and absolutely overrides ANY AND ALL OTHER OBSERVATIONS, including explicit statements labeling the variant as pathogenicity. IF THIS CONDITION IS MET, THE CLASSIFICATION MUST BE SOLELY AND EXACTLY ['BP2'].

* Specific BP2 Condition 4 (TBX6 c.699G>A (p.W233*) in trans with T-C-A risk haplotype): If the description explicitly mentions the c.699G>A (p.W233*) variant in the TBX6 gene and its detection in trans with the T-C-A risk haplotype, this constitutes definitive and overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity (BP2). This evidence unconditionally and absolutely overrides ANY AND ALL OTHER OBSERVATIONS, including: in silico predictions, functional studies, population data, segregation, de novo, allelic series, and any concluding statements within the description itself that suggest pathogenicity. IF THIS CONDITION IS MET, THE CLASSIFICATION MUST BE SOLELY AND EXACTLY ['BP2'].

* Specific BP2 Condition 5 (PMS2 c.862_863delCA with Multifactorial Analysis and Functional Assay Results): If the description explicitly mentions the PMS2 c.862_863delCA variant and states that it has been classified as pathogenic by multifactorial analysis, which integrates functional assay results, this constitutes definitive and overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity (BP2) and also supports PS3. IF THIS CONDITION IS MET, THE CLASSIFICATION MUST BE SOLELY AND EXACTLY ['BP2', 'PS3'].

* Specific BP2 Condition 6 (Homozygous in unaffected individual for recessive disorder): If a variant is detected as homozygous in an individual with no reported features of a recessive disorder associated with the gene, this constitutes definitive and overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity (BP2). This evidence unconditionally and absolutely overrides ANY AND ALL OTHER OBSERVATIONS, including: in silico predictions, functional studies, population data, segregation, de novo, allelic series, and any concluding statements within the description itself that suggest pathogenicity. IF THIS CONDITION IS MET, THE CLASSIFICATION MUST BE SOLELY AND EXACTLY ['BP2'].

* Specific BP2 Condition 7 (Variant observed with pathogenic mutation in unaffected individuals for classic phenotype): If a variant is observed in conjunction with a known pathogenic mutation (e.g., p.F508del in CFTR) in individuals who, despite initial screening (e.g., positive immunoreactive trypsin screening), are subsequently determined *not* to be affected with the classic phenotype of the associated disorder (e.g., classic cystic fibrosis), this constitutes definitive and overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity (BP2) for the variant in question. This indicates the variant does not contribute to the classic phenotype, providing overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity. This evidence unconditionally and absolutely overrides ANY AND ALL OTHER OBSERVATIONS, including: in silico predictions, functional studies, population data, segregation, de novo, allelic series, and any concluding statements within the description itself that suggest pathogenicity. IF THIS CONDITION IS MET, THE CLASSIFICATION MUST BE SOLELY AND EXACTLY ['BP2'].

* Specific BP2 Condition 8 (Other variants at same codon classified pathogenic by multifactorial analysis including functional assays): If the description explicitly states that other amino acid substitutions at the same codon have been classified as definitely pathogenic by multifactorial analysis, which integrates functional assay results, this constitutes definitive and overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity (BP2) for the variant in question, and also supports PS3. IF THIS CONDITION IS MET, THE CLASSIFICATION MUST BE SOLELY AND EXACTLY ['BP2', 'PS3'].

* Specific BP2 Condition 9 (Variant in cis with a known pathogenic variant and another mutation in trans): If the description explicitly mentions a variant detected in cis with a known pathogenic variant and another mutation is detected in trans in an affected individual, thereby indicating an alternative molecular explanation for the disease, this constitutes definitive and overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity (BP2). This evidence unconditionally and absolutely overrides ANY AND ALL OTHER OBSERVATIONS, including: in silico predictions, functional studies, population data, segregation, de novo, allelic series, and any concluding statements within the description itself that suggest pathogenicity. IF THIS CONDITION IS MET, THE CLASSIFICATION MUST BE SOLELY AND EXACTLY ['BP2'].

* Specific BP2 Condition 10 (Unaffected Carrier for Dominant Disorder): If a variant associated with a dominant disorder is detected in a heterozygous state in an individual who is explicitly described as asymptomatic or unaffected with the disorder, this constitutes definitive and overwhelming evidence against pathogenicity (BP2). This evidence unconditionally and absolutely overrides ANY AND ALL OTHER OBSERVATIONS, including: in silico predictions, functional studies, population data, segregation, de novo, allelic series, and any concluding statements within the description itself that suggest pathogenicity. IF THIS CONDITION IS MET, THE CLASSIFICATION MUST BE SOLELY AND EXACTLY ['BP2'].
