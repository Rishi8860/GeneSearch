1. ACMG ATTRIBUTE CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES (BENIGN/UNCERTAIN ONLY):    *   Output Format Mandate:        *   The final output MUST be a Python list of strings.        *   It MUST contain ONLY valid ACMG criteria (e.g., BS3, BP4, BS1, BP6).        *   ABSOLUTELY NO FREE-FORM TEXT, INTERPRETATIONS, OR SUMMARY STATEMENTS ARE ALLOWED.        *   The output list MUST ALWAYS contain EXACTLY ONE ACMG attribute. This is a strict requirement for all classifications.    *   Scope of Classification:        *   This classification system is STRICTLY for benign (BS, BP) or uncertain (BS3) ACMG attributes.        *   Pathogenic (PS, PM, PP) attributes are strictly excluded from consideration and output.    *   Benign Lean Principle:        *   In cases of conflicting evidence or general uncertainty, the classification should always lean towards benign criteria, unless the BS3 overriding principle (detailed below) applies.2. OVERRIDING PRINCIPLE: UNCERTAIN CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE (BS3 MANDATE):    *   Absolute Priority: This is the MOST CRITICAL and ABSOLUTE rule. It takes precedence over all other considerations.    *   Trigger Condition: This rule is activated if the description EXPLICITLY states that the clinical significance of the variant remains unclear due to:        *   Contradictory evidence.        *   Limited supporting evidence.        *   Overall uncertainty regarding its clinical impact.    *   Sole and Exclusive Output: When triggered, BS3 is the SOLE, EXCLUSIVE, and ONLY applicable ACMG attribute. The output MUST be ['BS3'].    *   Absolute Override Mechanism: This condition (overall unclear clinical significance) ABSOLUTELY OVERRIDES ALL OTHER lines of evidence, regardless of their individual strength or implications.    *   No Other Criteria Evaluation: Crucially, if BS3 is determined, NO OTHER ACMG criteria (including any other benign criteria like BP4, BS1, etc.) SHALL BE EVALUATED, APPLIED, or INCLUDED in the output. The uncertainty represented by BS3 completely negates the consideration of any other specific benign indicators.    *   Singular Representation: BS3 will appear only once in the output list, representing the singular determination of unclear clinical significance. It will never be duplicated.    *   CRITICAL ACTION: If this rule is triggered, STOP ALL FURTHER EVALUATION IMMEDIATELY and output ['BS3']. Do not attempt to find other criteria or duplicate BS3.3. GENERALIZED BENIGN CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE (WHEN BS3 IS NOT APPLICABLE):    *   Applicability: This section applies ONLY when the BS3 overriding principle (Point 2) is NOT applicable. This means the description does NOT explicitly state
