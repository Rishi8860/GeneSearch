Frameshift alterations are typically deleterious in nature (Richards, 2015). The alteration is not observed in healthy cohorts: Based on data from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), the SF3B4 c.1147DUPC alteration was not observed among 6,476 individuals tested. Allele frequency data for this nucleotide position are not currently available from the 1000 Genomes Project and the alteration is not currently listed in the Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP). The alteration has been observed in affected individuals: This alteration was previously reported in a one year old male and his 28 year old mother. Both individuals had dwonslanted palperbral fissures, micrognathia, abnormal soft palate, abnormal ears, and hearing loss. The son was absent his right thumb and had a small left thumb.

This alteration is currently listed in the Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP) under rs119476050. Though some variants may appear to be rare due to database-specific ethnic underrepresentation, rare missense alleles commonly exhibit a deleterious effect on protein function (Kryukov, 2007; Tennessen, 2012). The R415W missense alteration has been reported in several HSP families. The first report is an Italian family with pure autosomal dominant HSP (D'Amico, 2004). The proband was a 22-year old woman with slowly progressive HSP starting at age 3. Her brother and a maternal second cousin had a similar phenotype, while a maternal uncle and maternal great-uncle had infantile onset spastic paraparesis. The alteration was present in all affected individuals but was also present in nine unaffected relatives, who had normal neurological evaluations and motor evoked potentials (age range was 13-70 years). It was absent in 400 control chromosomes. This alteration was concluded to be a likely low penetrance mutation affected by modulator genes or strong epigenetic factors, although a neutral polymorphism could not be ruled out. This alteration was subsequently identified in second large family with apparently X-linked pure HSP. The alteration was present in three affected males and three unaffected family members, consistent with incomplete penetrance. Two of the unaffected carriers were women, and family history indicated that most unaffected women were obligate carriers. These findings were consistent with sex-associated reduced penetrance of this mutation. Varga et al. (2013) identified the same mutation in 1 of 83 Spanish patients with apparent sporadic HSP and in 2 of 28 Russian patients with dominant HSP. Evidence again suggested incomplete penetrance in these families._x000D_ _x000D_ A missense alteration affecting the same amino acid, R415Q, was reported in a consanguinous Moroccan family with childhood onset HSP (Varga, 2013).

Three of the affected individuals were found to be homozygous for the R415Q alteration and the fourth was heterozygous (three unaffected siblings and the parents were also heterozygous).

Within these families, the c.[-27C>A;85G>T] haplotype was associated with differing levels of MLH1 promoter constitutional methylation and with loss of PMS2 and/or MLH1 staining on immunohistochemistry in tumor samples (Kwok CT et al.

In contrast, luciferase reporter assays performed for the c.85G>T alteration showed little to no reduction in promoter activity compared to wild type suggesting the c.-27C>A alteration accounts for allelic repression of MLH1 transcription resulting in loss of MLH1 expression; however, a direct causal relationship has yet to be clarified (Hitchins MP et al.

In silico splice site analysis predicts that this alteration will weaken the native splice acceptor site and may result in the creation or strengthening of a novel splice acceptor site. However, RNA experiments for other alterations at this splice site have shown coding exon 7 splicing alterations to express an in-frame transcript, known as 6q39_8 in the literature (Ambry internal data). This transcript has been shown to be able to perform homology directed repair in protein functional studies at a near wild-type level (Mesman, RLS et al. Genet Med 2020 08;22(8):1355-1365). A functional study performed in mES cells found the c.632-2A>G variant to result in reduced, but some residual, wild-type BRCA2 activity. They also reported that this alteration conferred hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents and PARP inhibitors (Stauffer S et al. J Hum Genet. 2020 Sep;65(9):805-809).

Analysis by qRT-PCR and Western blot showed that the heterozygous control with only the c.815-27T>C alteration had reduced mRNA expression (74%) and protein expression (59%) compared to wild type controls, and the patient with the [c.166G>A (p.G56R); c.815-27T>C] complex allele and complex rearrangement on the other allele had more significant reduction in mRNA expression (15%) and undetectable protein expression (Tucker, 2012).

In a recent study including ten families with the p.R661W alteration, authors reported that if this alteration was maternally inherited the probability of being affected with RB was just under 10% whereas if this alteration was paternally inherited the probability of being affected with RB was almost 68%. They speculate that this parent-of-origin effect is due to maternal imprinting of an internal promoter which produces an alternative RB1 transcript and may contribute to the reduced penetrance of this mutation (Eloy P et al. PLoS Genet. 2016 Feb;12:e1005888; Kanber D et al. PLoS Genet. 2009 Dec;5:e1000790).

This nucleotide position is not well conserved in available vertebrate species. Functional RNA studies of c.1909+22G>A demonstrated a mild effect on splicing due to activation of an out of frame cryptic splice site which resulted in partial intron 14 retention and a transcript that was partially degraded by nonsense mediated decay (Minnerop, 2017; Rydning, 2019; Morales-Rosado, 2020).

Amino acid substitutions of this asparagine (N) in M3 (N641 in GRIA4) were shown to strongly diminish Ca2+ permeability under physiological conditions indicating a significant role for this asparagine during Ca2+ influx in the GluR4 (and other glutamate) receptors (Jatzke, 2003).

In addition to the clinical data presented in the literature, this alteration is expected to result in loss of function by premature protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. As such, this alteration is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation.","['BP2', 'PS3']",Both
