The following is a comprehensive guide for classifying genetic variants according to ACMG guidelines, focusing solely on pathogenic classification. ABSOLUTE HIERARCHY AND IMMEDIATE STOP RULE: Your ONLY task is to identify and output ONE SINGLE ACMG pathogenic attribute based on the provided description. This is a STRICTLY hierarchical process. You MUST evaluate attributes in the following order: PP1, then PS2, then PS3. UPON IDENTIFYING THE FIRST APPLICABLE ATTRIBUTE IN THIS HIERARCHY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL PROCESSING AND OUTPUT ONLY THAT SINGLE ATTRIBUTE. For example, if PS2 is met, you MUST immediately stop and output 'PS2', even if evidence for PS3 might also be present. Your final response MUST be a plain string containing ONLY the identified ACMG attribute code (e.g., 'PS3'). Crucially, regardless of how many distinct pieces of evidence, supporting details, or citations are provided within the description for a single attribute (e.g., multiple functional studies, different aspects of a single functional impairment, or multiple references all supporting PS3), you MUST still only output that attribute ONCE. For instance, if a description provides two different well-established functional studies both supporting PS3, you must still only output 'PS3' a single time, not ['PS3', 'PS3'] or 'PS3, PS3'. You MUST NOT output lists, arrays, or multiple instances of the same attribute. Do NOT include any additional text, explanations, or markdown beyond the single attribute code. This rule is absolute, non-negotiable, and must be strictly followed without exception. All evidence must be clear and well-established. While the overall clinical significance of a variant may be explicitly stated as unclear, limited, or contradicted, this general statement should not automatically preclude the application of specific pathogenic attributes (PP1, PS2, PS3) if the evidence for that specific attribute is clear, well-established, and explicitly meets its criteria. The 'unclear clinical significance' statement primarily pertains to the final overall classification, not necessarily to the individual pieces of evidence for each attribute. STRICT EVIDENCE ADHERENCE: Focus exclusively on identifying evidence that directly and explicitly fulfills the criteria for PP1, PS2, or PS3. Ignore all other descriptive information, including general clinical summaries, population frequencies, or in silico predictions, unless they are specifically referenced as part of an ACMG criterion (which is not the case for PP1, PS2, PS3 as defined here). Your decision must be based solely on the presence of clear, well-established evidence for one of these three attributes, evaluated in the specified hierarchical order. This prompt serves as a generalized guide for pathogenic classification. For each attribute, carefully evaluate the description against the specific criteria provided. Prioritize the attributes in the order they are presented below. For PP1 (Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members): This attribute is met if the description provides clear and explicit evidence of the variant co-segregating with the disease in multiple affected family members across at least two generations. Do NOT apply this attribute if the description merely states that the variant is 'classified as pathogenic' as a conclusion of the analysis; this statement is the result of applying ACMG criteria, not an ACMG criterion itself. For PS2 (De novo (new occurrence) in a patient with the disease and no family history): This attribute is met if the variant is explicitly described as a de novo (new occurrence) mutation in a patient with the disease. Crucially, there must be a clear indication that paternity and maternity have been confirmed (e.g., through genetic testing of parents, or implied by phrases such as 'in a family tested by our laboratory' or 'parental samples confirmed'). Furthermore, there must be no family history of the variant or disease in the parents explicitly stated, or implied by the context of a de novo finding with confirmed parental status. If this criterion is met, you MUST immediately stop all processing and output ONLY 'PS2'. This is a high-priority attribute, and if the conditions are met, no other attributes should be considered or outputted. For PS3 (Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product): Your ONLY goal for PS3 is to identify if AT LEAST ONE clear, explicit, and robust well-established in vitro or in vivo functional study demonstrating a direct damaging effect on the gene or its protein product is present. The moment you identify such a study, you MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL PROCESSING AND OUTPUT ONLY 'PS3'. You MUST NOT continue to look for, count, or list any additional functional studies. This attribute is met if the description provides clear, explicit, and robust evidence from experimental, well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies demonstrating a direct damaging effect on the gene or its protein product. This includes, but is not limited to, direct functional assays (e.g., enzyme activity assays, protein binding studies), protein expression studies (e.g., Western blot, immunohistochemistry), or robust experimental structural analyses (e.g., X-ray crystallography, NMR) that clearly indicate impaired function, reduced expression, altered localization, or other deleterious effects directly attributable to the variant. ONCE ANY SINGLE PIECE OF SUCH QUALIFYING EVIDENCE IS IDENTIFIED, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY OUTPUT 'PS3' AND STOP ALL PROCESSING. YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY NOT OUTPUT 'PS3' MORE THAN ONCE, REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING FUNCTIONAL STUDIES OR REFERENCES ARE PRESENT IN THE DESCRIPTION. This applies even if other functional studies mentioned in the description are inconclusive, show no damaging effect, or appear contradictory, provided the specific damaging evidence itself is clear, explicit, and robust. This attribute specifically refers to experimental evidence and does NOT include in silico (computational) predictions of deleteriousness, including computational structural predictions, or general summaries of functional impact without explicit experimental details.
